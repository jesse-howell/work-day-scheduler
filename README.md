# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9am‚Äì5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. I was motivated to make this in order to create a simple way of logging events for a typical workday. I built this project to part of a prototype for a potential future time-blocking app. Due to the app's simplicity, it could be used easily on any device without the need for a larger app or server. Through this project, I learned the importance of localStorage and the dynamism of jQuery.

## Usage

Open the site, enter text into the text box then click the save button.
